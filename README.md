# Security Factory (Random Password Generator)

![Password generator application](./assets/images/03-javascript-homework-demo.png)


## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a simple-to-use password generator using window alerts. Coming up with a password that is secure can be difficult, and this program distills that process down into a few seconds.

The key thing about javascript that I learned while working on this is that there are a lot of different ways to accomplish any given task. For example, I used whiles to ensure that a valid input was entered in the workflow, but there are certainly different (possibly better) ways to validate inputs.
